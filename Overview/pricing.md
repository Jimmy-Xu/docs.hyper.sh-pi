# Pricing & Billing

_Pi_ use a _pay-per-use_ billing model, similar to other cloud services, such like AWS EC2. You pay only for the resources you use by the second, no minimum fee.

> To see your bill, go to your [billing history](https://console.hyper.sh/billing/history). Your bill contains links to usage reports that provide details about your bill.

#### Compute

- **Image**:
	- Image is a self-contained package that includes application, configuration and data. _Pi_ will pull your images from 3rd-party registry and launch them. We do not offer our own registry at the moment.
	- Currently image is **FREE**.

- **Pod**:
	- Pod is charged by the computational resources it consumes (CPU, RAM) and the duration it runs (by the second).
	- We provide a set of predefined resource configurations for you to choose when launching pods. Different configurations come with different resource specifications, thus different price.
	- Billing begins when a pod is started, ends when the pod terminates (through API call), or exits (success or failure).
	- Everytime a pod is started, a default duration of 60 seconds is applied. If a pod runs for 40s, it will be billed for 60s; if it runs for 100s, it is billed for 100s.

|Size|CPU|Mem|Per Second|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|S1 | 1|64MB |$0.00000222|
|S2 | 1|128MB|$0.00000354|
|S3 | 1|256MB|$0.00000564|
|S4 | 1|512MB|$0.000009  |
|M1 | 1|  1GB|$0.0000144 |
|M2 | 1|  2GB|$0.0000288 |
|M3 | 1|  4GB|$0.0000576 |
|L1 | 2|  8GB|$0.0001152 |
|L2 | 4| 16GB|$0.0002304 |
|L3 | 8| 32GB|$0.0004608 |
|L4 |16| 60GB|$0.0009216 |
|L5 |32|120GB|$0.0018432 |
|L6 |64|240GB|$0.0036864 |

#### Automatic Sustained Use Discounts
Similar with [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing), your Pods will qualify for a sustained use discount. The discounts are applied automatically and will be calculated and added to your bill. There is no action needed on your part to enable sustained use discounts.

|Usage Duration (second)|% at which incremental is charged|Example (M1 size)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0-600    | 100% of base rate | $0.0000144/second |
|600-3600 |  67% of base rate | $0.0000096/second |
|3600+    |  33% of base rate | $0.0000048/second |

> **Example**:
> For a _M1_ pod to run for an entire month, the pod will cost:
> - First 600 seconds: 600*$0.0000144 = $0.00864
> - The next 3000 seconds: 3000*$0.0000096 = $0.0288
> - The rest of the month: 3600*(24\*30-1)*$0.0000048 = $12.42432
>
> - Total: $0.00864 + $0.0288 + $12.42432 = $12.46176

#### Storage

- **Rootfs**:
	- A pod may have one or more containers.
	- Every container come with a default 10GB rootfs, e.g. if a pod have 3 containers, the pod has three rootfs, 30GB in total.
	- Rootfs exits along with the lifecycle of the pod. Billing begins when the pod is created, ends when the pod terminates or exists.
	- A default duration of 60 seconds is applied.

- **Volume**:
	- The volume size ranges from 10 to 1024 GB, and the default size is 10GB.
	- Volume is independent from the pod's lifecycle. Thus, the billing begins when a volume is created, ends upon removal.
	- A default duration of 60 seconds is applied.

 - **Secret**: Free

|Type|Per Second|Monthly|
|---|---|---|
|Rootfs|$0.0000000386/GB|$0.1/GB|
|Volume|$0.0000000386/GB|$0.1/GB|

#### Network
- **Traffic**:
	- Currently all network traffic are **Free**.
- **Service**:
	- $0.03/hour
	- Billing begins when a new service is created, ends when it is deleted. Partial hour will be counted as an hour.
	- A default duration of 1 hour is applied.
- **Floating IP**:
	- If you allocate a floating IP address but do not use it, you will be charged with an hourly rate. If you use it (with _Service_), you will not be charged for it.

|Type|Hourly|
|---|---|
|Floating IP address (assigned but unused)|$0.01/IP|
|Floating IP address (assigned and in use)|Free|
